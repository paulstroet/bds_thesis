## Welcome
My name is [Paul Stroet](https://paulstroet.netlify.app/) and currently I am writing my thesis for the research master program Business Data Science. On this page I post weekly updates about the progress of my thesis. 

### Data collection
In this section, I illustrate briefly how I collect my data. First, I take one random document from the list of 284 plenary sessions held in the 54th parliamentary term, say plenary session 111. 

```R
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/paulstroet/bds_thesis/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
